# CFD-Assignment-1
2D steady state problem of heat conduction along with heat generation
It is a CFD formulation code in C++ where the governing diffferential equation is solved by discretization and Gauss Siedal and obtained the results for different grid size.
The results are then ploted on TECHPLOT 360 which gives the contour and surface plots for the given problem.
